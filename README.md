# PixelMatrixFun-Android
 PixelMatrixFun Android App

Prototype of Android app for [this other project](https://github.com/aalku/PixelMatrixFun-ESP32).

It currenty supports choosing an image from the gallery or taking a picture. It's sent to the hardware wiressly via BLE without any configuration. It will just find it and send the image. It currently takes a few seconds.

Nice features that would be nice to have (but we dont!):
* Animations.
* Realtime pixelated preview of picture taking.
* Text scroll feature (I love MS Small Fonts).
* Realtime finger drawing (just imagine a friend of yours drawing d*cks on your e-sweater while you are in a pub).

I have a lot of ideas to improve this but I don't think I will put the effort. If you are interested just tell me to do it and it will increase the chances :)
